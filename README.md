# animated-ilustration
An exercise for Datenwerk

Here you can find an example of an animated ilustration which I created using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

I did this project that way so that it can work in different browsers and it is responsive.

I didn't use any other framework because I wanted it to be simple and good.

I also used git and Gihub for storing the project on the cloud and for tracking the progress of my work.
